# Bayesian inference

$$
\begin{aligned}
\overbrace{p(\theta | \text{Data})}^{\text{posterior}} &= \frac{\overbrace{p(\text{Data} | \theta)}^{\text{likelihood}} \times \overbrace{p(\theta)}^{\text{prior}}}{\underbrace{p(\text{Data})}_{\text{marginal likelihood}}} \\
&\propto p(\text{Data} | \theta) \times p(\theta) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

# Bayesian Inference: The Good

1.  Directly estimates quantity of interest $p(\theta | \text{Data})$ (with uncertainty!)

--

1.  Separates model from estimation

--

1.  Separates inference from decision

--

1.  Common paradigm for inference and prediction

--

1.  Prior can incorporate domain expertise

---

# Bayesian Inference: The Bad

1.  Integration ${\Huge\int} ucks$

--

1.  ... especially in high dimensions

---

# A Sample of the History of Bayesian Computation

1.  Pre-1990s: mostly analytic
1.  1990s: Gibbs sampling, personal computing
1.  2010s: Autodiff, HMC, Variational Inference

# Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

-   HMC :: Integration : BFGS :: Optimization

---

# What was needed for HMC adoption?

-   HMC - Neal (1993) 

--

-   No-U-Turn (NUTS) Sampler (Hoffman, Gelman 2011) to auto-tune hyperparameters

--

-   Automatic differentiation to calculate gradients
